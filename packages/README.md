# Internally Shared Packages

This folder contains shared configurations and utilities for the monorepo. While the apps in this monorepo do not directly depend on these packages, they are included to provide a complete template for those who want to use the entire monorepo rather than individual apps.

**Available Packages**

- `tsconfig`: A shared TypeScript configuration.
- `eslint-config`: A shared ESLint configuration.
